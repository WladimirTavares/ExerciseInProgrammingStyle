# Exercises in Programming Style

In the book Exercises in Programming Style, the author proposes a solution to the term frequency problem in different programming styles in the Python language. In this repository, we will present the solution in three different styles in Java:

* Cookbook (Procedural)
* Pipeline (Functional)
* Things (Object Oriented)

**Problem** : Given a text file, display the 25 most frequent words and their corresponding frequency in descending order by frequency value. Also, the text needs to be normalized to lowercase and the list of stop words present in the file needs to be ignored.
